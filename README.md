# Sort-Visualization
A program to visualize the sorting of an array using a variety of different sorting algorithms.

## Description
The program creates an array of integers from the user-specified conditions, which include the size of the array and the largest possible element in the array.
The array is displayed on the user interface such that the x corresponds to the index in the array (scaled to the size of the screen) and the y corresponds to the value at the index.
Every display update, the array is partially sorted using the `sort(int)` method in `SortingAlgorithm`.

## Implemented Algorithms
A few sorting algorithms have been implemented including: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Bucket Sort.
